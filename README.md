# wordle_game
This repository contains the Wordle game, developed in Java as part of the 'Introduction to Programming' course in the Computer Science and Business Management Bachelor's degree program at Iscte. Wordle is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of the letters and their positions. The project received the maximum grade (A) but can benefit from code improvements to enhance readability and simplicity, with a focus on object-oriented principles.

To visualize the game, ensure that PandionJ is installed in Eclipse. You can find a detailed description of the project in the "Project Statement" file.

Feel free to explore, contribute and further enhance the game!
